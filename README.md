# AlphaScreen Inhibitor Screening Curve Fit
Python package that reads Excel input file containing AlphaScreen data, produces sigmoid fit according to the following equation provided by GraphPad (non-open-source statistics software): 

<code>Y=100/(1+10^(X-LogIC50))<code>

Along with the graphs, it will also display the IC50, 95% confidence interval and R-squared value.

This code is intended to generate a single graph for each inhibitor used in a multi-inhibitor screen, where each inhibitor is tested at the same series of concentrations.

### Instructions:
1. Obtain AlphaScreen data and arrange data points by descending inhibitor concentration. 
2. Delete data in Input.xlsx and replace with your data. Ensure your positive zero-concentration data points are in the bottom row, along with a zero value for the concentration column. Keep the concentration column on the left.

3. Ensure Input.xlsx and AlphaScreen-Curve-Fit.ipynb are in the same directory (same folder, not one in a folder and one in a subfolder) before running.
4. Open AlphaScreen-Curve-Fit.ipynb in the IDE of your choice, hit Run, and generate graphs! Sample output below:
